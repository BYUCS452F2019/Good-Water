# Response to Good-Water Pitch

_Spencer Young_

Hi,

I am interested in working on this project.
It is interesting to me because it is:

- Simple
    - The purpose and function of this project is easy to understand, which
        will make development and testing quicker.
- Realistic
    - The project has a narrow scope. It will require minimal research and it
        should not require learning too many technologies to make it work.
- Useful
    - There is a clear benefit for the users to have information about where to
        find the best water on campus.
        The value this provides will generate engagement and in return better
        data for the service.

I would be happy to work on either the front-end interface or the server.

## Considerations

### Business

This product provides clear value to a user interested in finding the best
drinking water. After building a userbase, this could be monetized through ads
or by using the collected data.

### Legal

There do not seem to be strong legal implications here. It is probably important
that we state we are not affiliated with the university. We should also be
willing to remove false or potentially harmful information.

### Technical

In practice, this application will not receive an incredibly high volume of
concurrent users, so there is no immediate need for load balancing, caching,
etc. It can have a simple database containing each review, and recalculate the
average rating for each location as they are updated. A simple web front-end
would suffice for this.

## Conclusion

I think that this is a good project and I would be valuable in developing it.

Thanks,

Spencer Young
